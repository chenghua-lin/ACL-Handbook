## Overview of Responsibilities

The Local Organization Chairs at *CL conferences are responsible for overseeing and coordinating all of the local contacts to conference locations, restauratns, print services, tourist info, and coordinate requests regarding local organization. The main final event location and catering coordination including any budget decisions is the responsibility of the main event management. The local chairs assist the main event management and all other chairs, but have neither budget nor other direct decision responsibility.\
\
**The following are the main responsibilities of the Local Chairs:**

**1. Arrange Conference Venues**
The main conference venue is a decision of the time before the final hosting decision has been taken. It requires substantial availability of local organizers and ideally tourist boards/organizations to support the process. The request for visitng local potential venues for the main conference as well as other side events had happend on extremely short notice, for which researchers usually neither have the time nor the contacts. Thus, a profficient tourism office with the time and contacts would be beneficial for the application as well as organization process. 

**2. Social Events & Optional Visitor Activities**
The main social event requires local organizers to provide different available options to be proposed to the general chairs and ACL as such. This requires identifying interesting nationally representative options and asking for specific quotes in order to provide concrete information to these bodies. It also requires getting in touch with social events in terms of temporal availability and quotes. As regards visitor activities, there should be several options for participants to obtain information for local sights, restaurants, events at the time of the conference, etc. should ideally be provided on the website and ideally be supported by a local info desk for tourist info during the conference. 

**So far *CL conferences have collaborated with a centrally assigned event management, the cost of which are incorporated into the conference budget. This also means that the main decision and budget responsibility is clearly in the hands of this event management, leaving Local Chairs with the task of collaborating and supporting them.**
