## Overview of Responsibilities  
Student Volunteers (SVs) are the on‑the‑ground backbone of *ACL conferences – staffing registration, session rooms, and special events while gaining professional experience and financial support. The SV Chairs coordinate every aspect of that programme:

Student volunteers are typically asked for **10 hours of work**, in exchange for free conference registration, ACL membership for the current year, workshops, tutorials, and social events.*


**The following are the main responsibilities of the Student Volunteer Chairs:**

**1. Planning & Funding**   
**2. Recruitment & Selection**   
**3. Scheduling, Training & Logistics**  
**4. On‑site Coordination**

\* If students require further funding for travel and accommodation, this is **not** included in the Student Volunteering package and students should be encouraged to apply for Diversity & Inclusion grants to cover these costs.

## Breakdown of Responsibilities

### 1. Planning & Funding  
This responsibility sets the numerical and financial boundaries of the entire SV programme. SV Chairs liaise with SIGDAT/ACL to learn how many fee‑waiver scholarships can be underwritten, decide whether to pursue additional grants (e.g. an National Science Foundation [[NSF]](https://www.nsf.gov/) student‐travel proposal if there is a US‑based co‑chair), and review lessons learned from previous years to estimate application volume and staffing needs.

| Task                                                  | Start    | Deadline | Dependency        | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Contact Previous Year's Chairs                        | ASAP     | Jul 2024 | –                 | Early insights on application numbers, useful forms, shift templates. |
| Confirm Quantity of Scholarships SIGDAT/ACL Can Cover | Dec 2024 | Jan 2025 | Budget Approval   | -                                                                     |
| (Optional) Draft External Grant Proposals (e.g. NSF)  | Jan 2025 | Feb 2025 | US‑based Co‑chair | -                                                                     |

### 2. Recruitment & Selection  
This responsibility concerns open a Call for Volunteers, collecting applications, and choosing volunteers plus a small wait‑list.

Priority selection should be given to full-time students at undergraduate and graduate level who are presenting a paper at the main conference or associated workshop and demonstrate financial need. Following this, it may be possible to open applications to postdocs and very recent PhDs who have not yet secured employment.

| Task                                                  | Start    | Deadline | Dependency          | Notes                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### 3. Scheduling, Training & Logistics  
After the main programme schedule is frozen, SV Chairs map individual volunteers to specific tutorial, main‑conference, and workshop duties, aiming for balanced workloads and preference accommodation.

| Task                                                                      | Start                         | Deadline          | Dependency          | Notes                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Create detailed volunteer shift roster (tutorials, main conf., workshops) | When final programme released | 2 weeks pre‑conf. | Conference Schedule | Provide options for preferences; aim ≥2 shifts per SV |
| Order Volunteer T‑shirts                                                  | 2 weeks pre‑conf.             | 1 week pre‑conf.  | Sizes Collected     | Budget via Local Chairs                               |
| Run Online Orientation & Q&A                                              | 1 week pre‑conf.              | 1 week pre‑conf.  | Finalized Roster    | Record session for late arrivals                      |

---

### 4. On‑site Coordination  
During the event the chairs function as shift supervisors and problem‑solvers.  They oversee Day‑0 set‑up with the local team, hold daily stand‑ups and wrap‑ups to maintain a team spirit emphasised in the handbook, and manage real‑time communications (Slack/WhatsApp) to plug any staffing gaps. 

| Task                                      | Start                  | Deadline          | Dependency | Notes                                               |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Day‑0 set‑up with Registration Desk       | Day Before Conference  | –                 | -          | Badge stuffing, signage, info desk set‑up           |
| Daily Morning Huddle & End‑of‑Day Debrief | Each Day of Conference | –                 | -          | Reinforce “team spirit” ethos as per handbook       |
| Real‑time Issue Handling & Backup Shifts  | During Conference      | During Conference | –          | Keep WhatsApp/Slack channel with SVs & Local Chairs |
