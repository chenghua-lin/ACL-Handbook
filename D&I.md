### 2. D&I Registration Subsidy Allocation
D&I subsidies consist of registration, caregiving, bandwidth, travel, and VPN subsidies. ACL strongly encourages researchers from developing countries and marginalized communities, students, and researchers with financial hurdles to apply for both D&I subsidies and volunteering opportunities to maximize their chances of waiving their registration fees.

**Virtual Registration Subsidy Note:** Discounted virtual registration may be offered to those who did not receive a standard D&I subsidy. There are the following exceptions: (1) Authors with accepted papers, (2) Employed/funded individuals/students from: the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and higher-income countries in Asia and the Middle East. The timeline approximately follows that shown below. However, there is no funding cap (pending approval from the ACL Executive Committee) - chairs should determine the level of subsidy for Virtual registration on a per-applicant basis (inc. whether or not to waive the ACL membership fee).
